# Script for automatic ENS registation. One ENS costs around 15.6$ on 15 gwei.

ENS name is generated using combination of two words from dictionary.
"perform" + "perhaps" = "performperhaps.eth"

## Steps to start the code:

- Install Node.js if you don't have one (could be checked using `node -v` command)
- Create file `eth_privates.txt` with your private keys
- Run `npm install` to install packages
- Run `npm run start` to start the code

## Additional:
- You can change the words dictionary in the `words.const.js` file, if needed
